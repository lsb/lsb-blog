<blockquote><i>5th gym day back. How does adult life not come with participation trophies? I could really go for some false recognition right about now.</i></blockquote>

<p>It turns out that <a href="https://github.com/lsb/turk-rest-api">turk-rest-api</a> makes that really easy.</p>

<p>I collected some <a href="http://vivam.us/human/ask?instructions=Life+counseling,+one+text+box+at+a+time.&distinctUsers=20&cost=10&question=%7B%22Text%22%3A%7B%22questionText%22%3A%22This%20is%20my%20fifth%20day%20back%20at%20the%20gym.%20Please%20respond.%22%2C%22defaultText%22%3A%22%22%7D%7D">results</a> of twenty random strangers from the internet who wanted to be paid ten cents to write literally anything; the description of the task was <i>Life counseling, one text box at a time.</i>, and the question was <i>This is my fifth day back at the gym. Please respond.</i>, and everyone who submitted an answer was accepted.</p>
