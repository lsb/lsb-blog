<li>And on the eigth day, after His rest, the Lord looked down upon His creations, and he was still not satisfied.</li>
<li>He could see how He had commingled cows into Hot Dog sausage,</li>
<li>and He could see the supply chain girt around the globe devoted to the m&eacute;lange of many colors;</li>
<li>and He could see Man and Woman, eating of the Hot Dog sausage, and praising Him;</li>
<li>and He could see Man and Woman, on His sandy shores, stretching in repose, praising His gift of long tan legs.</li>
<li>And the Lord protected them from the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil,</li>
<li>and guided them to a lesson, though their senses were too coarse to grasp it.</li>
<li>He took His Polaroid&#0153; and rendered unto them severally likenesses of their legs, upon the shore, tan and smooth,</li>
<li>and thereafter He took His Polaroid&#0153; and rendered unto them severally likeness of Hot Dog sausages, in the same pose, of the same hue.</li>
<li><a href="http://hot-dog-legs.tumblr.com/">And Man and Woman looked upon their legs, and looked upon the Hot Dog sausages, and could not discern the difference. And they praised the Lord.</a></li>
