<p>This blog is compiled in <a href="https://github.com/lsb/blog.sh/"><code>blog.sh</code></a>!</p>

<p>What is <code>blog.sh</code>? It is new! It is a trio of shell scripts. It is open source.</p>

<p>First, novelty.  There are many frameworks for baking blogs, in many languages. But my blog needs are simple; my dependency tolerances are short; my desired operational longevity is long. Jekyll and Octopress require Ruby, which is fine now, but might be problematic in half a decade. I suspect my blog compilation needs, in particular my templating needs, can be satisfied by <code>echo</code> and <code>cat</code>, which are almost guaranteeed to exist in ten years. I had looked at <a href="https://github.com/carlesfe/bashblog">bashblog</a>, but bashblog mistakes cardinality for complexity; shoehorning a default css stylesheet inside a blog compiler is too complex, ties too many things together, though it makes for a good marketing phrase of &ldquo;just one file!&rdquo;. Also, all of the files (script, posts, css) are mashed up into one directory, which must not contain any non-blog html files, an interesting design decision.</p>

<p>Second, a trio of shell scripts. This is a strong opinion; other strong opinions forming the foundation of <code>blog.sh</code> include: avoiding Javascript is useful, minimizing page size and http requests is interesting, minimizing decoration on the page (to focus attention on the text) is paramount. The notion of being tracked by Urchin Analytics (and its descendents) around the Web is slightly unsettling, so I have no tracking cookies. (A blog post that demonstrates something via Javascript would necessarily have inline code running in the page.) The CSS is small enough that I shoehorned it into the page, and avoided the extra HTTP request. I like a single-column layout because it is versatile on many form factors (Kindle, mobile, paper) and because it affords good behaviors like intensely reading, versus distractedly glimpsing banner ads.</p>

<p>Third, <code>blog.sh</code> is <a href="https://github.com/lsb/blog.sh/">open source</a>! Please send me any pull requests for features. It currently weighs in at under a hundred lines of code and five assets (css, url, blog-title, colophon, and frontispiece), so it should be malleable and light-weight and fun.</p>
